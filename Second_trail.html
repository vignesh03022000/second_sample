    <a>The higher the specificity weight of a selector, the more superiority the selector is given when a styling conflict occurs. For example, if a paragraph element is selected using a type selector in one place and an ID selector in another, the ID selector will take precedence over the type selector regardless of where the ID selector appears in the cascade.

 <p id="Green">When selectors are combined they should be read from right to left. The selector farthest to the right, directly before the opening curly bracket, is known as the key selector. The key selector identifies exactly which element the styles will be applied to. Any selector to the left of the key selector will serve as a prequalifier.

The first combined selector above, .hotdog p, includes two selectors: a class and a type selector. These two selectors are separated by a single space. The key selector is a type selector targeting paragraph elements. And because this type selector is prequalified with a class selector of hotdog, the full combined selector will only select paragraph elements that reside within an element with a class attribute value of hotdog.

The second selector above,</p>
<hr/>
<p class="pink">hotdog p.mustard, includes three selectors: two class selectors and one type selector. The only difference between the second selector and the first selector is the addition of the class selector of mustard to the end of the paragraph type selector. Because the new class selector, mustard, falls all the way to the right of the combined selector, it is the key selector, and all of the individual selectors coming before it are now prequalifiers.

Spaces Within Selectors
Within the previous <br/><div id="combine"><strong>combined </strong></div>selector, .hotdog p.mustard, there is a space between the hotdog class selector and the paragraph type selector but not between the paragraph type selector and the mustard class selector. The use, and omission, of spaces makes a large difference in selectors.

Since there <p> isn’t a space between the paragraph type selector and the mustard class selector that means the selector will only select paragraph elements with the class of mustard. If the paragraph type selector was removed, and the mustard class selector had spaces on both sides of it, it would select any element with the class of mustard, not just paragraphs.

The best practice is to not prefix a class selector with a type selector. Generally we want to select any element with a given class, not just one type of element. And following this best practice, our new combined selector would be better as .hotdog .mustard.

Reading the combined selector from </p>
<hr/>
<p class="violet">right to left, it is targeting paragraphs with a class attribute value of mustard that reside within an element with the class attribute value of hotdog.

Different types of selectors can be combined to target any given element on a page. As we continue to write different combined selectors, we’ll see their powers come to life. Before we do that, though, let’s take a look at how combining selectors changes a selector’s specificity weight.

Specificity Within Combined Selectors
When selectors are combined, so are the specificity weights of the individual selectors. These combined specificity weights can be calculated by counting each different type of selector within a combined selector.

Looking at our combined selectors from before, the first selector, .hotdog p, had both a class selector and a type selector. Knowing that the point value of a class selector is 0-1-0 and the point value of a type selector is 0-0-1, the total combined point value would be 0-1-1, found by adding up each kind of selector.

The second selector, .hotdog p.mustard, had two class selectors and one type selector. Combined, the selector has a specificity point value of 0-2-1. The 0 in the first column is for zero ID selectors, the 2 in the second column is for two class selectors, and the 1 in the last column is for one type selector.

Comparing the two selectors, the second selector, with its two classes, has a noticeably higher specificity weight and point value. As such it will take precedence within the cascade. If we were to flip the order of these selectors within our style sheet, placing the higher-weighted selector above the lower-weighted selector as shown here, the appearance of their styles would not be affected due to each selector’s specificity weight.
